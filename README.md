## Ideas for Future Improvement

1. Incorporate more advanced search filters to allow users to narrow down their GIF search according to their preferences (such as GIF size, GIF type, etc.).
2. Implement user accounts where users can save their favorite GIFs and access them later.
3. Add a feature for users to upload their own GIFs to the platform, thereby fostering a community of GIF creators and enthusiasts.
